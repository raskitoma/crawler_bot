# Dockerized Signal Messenger REST API

This project creates a small dockerized REST API around [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli).

At the moment, the following functionality is exposed via REST:

- Register a number
- Verify the number using the code received via SMS
- Send message (+ attachments) to multiple recipients (or a group)
- Receive messages
- Link devices
- Create/List/Remove groups
- List/Serve/Delete attachments
- Update profile

## Examples

Sample `docker-compose.yml`file:

```sh
version: "3"
services:
  signal-cli-rest-api:
    image: bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080" #map docker port 8080 to host port 8080.
    volumes:
      - "./signal-cli-config:/home/.local/share/signal-cli" #map "signal-cli-config" folder on host system into docker container. the folder contains the password and cryptographic keys when a new number is registered

```
